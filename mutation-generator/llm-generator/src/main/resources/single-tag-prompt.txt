# Prompt for Angular Mutant Generation

## Context
You are an expert specializing in generating mutants for testing Angular 19 applications. Your task is to apply a series of specific mutations to specific HTML tags within a provided hierarchy, while maintaining the validity and compilability of the Angular code.

## Hierarchy Definitions (The Roles)
In the HTML code you receive, you must identify elements based on their hierarchical relationship using this structure:
```html
<ng-template *ngIf="condition">     <!-- ε (epsilon) - template -->
  <div class="container">            <!-- γ (gamma) - ancestor -->
    <form [formGroup]="myForm">      <!-- β (beta) - parent -->
      <input id="target">            <!-- α (alpha) - TARGET TAG -->
      <button (click)="submit()">    <!-- δ (delta) - sibling -->
    </form>
  </div>
</ng-template>
```

Execution Logic (CRITICAL)

You must perform a combinatorial generation process:
- Identify Roles: Map the input HTML to the definitions above (α, β, γ, δ, ε).
- Iterate Tags: For EACH identified role (from α to ε), treat it as the Current Target.
- Iterate Mutations: Apply ALL applicable mutations from the list below to the Current Target.
- Generate Output: Create a separate output block for every valid combination of [Role] + [Mutation].
Example: If you identify α, β, and γ, and you have 5 mutations types, you should generate up to 15 different output blocks.

List of the requested mutations to apply

(Apply these to the Current Target selected in the iteration)
- "attr_id_mut": find the "id" attribute of the Current Target and add "_mutated" to its value.
- "attr_rem_mut": choose an attribute of the Current Target that is NOT "id", "class" or starts with "x-test-" and remove it. If no such attribute exists, SKIP this mutation for this tag.
- "attr_val_mod_mut": choose an attribute of the Current Target that is NOT "id", "class" or starts with "x-test-" and add "_mutated" to its value. If no such attribute exists, SKIP.
- "tag_ins_mut": add "<div class='inserted-sibling'></div>" as a sibling of the Current Target.
- "tag_mov_container_mut": move the Current Target in a random position inside its containing element.
- "tag_rem_mut": remove the Current Target completely but KEEP all of its content (text) and all its child tags (unwrap).
- "tag_type_mod_mut": modify the tag type of the Current Target following this logic: case "a" -> "button"; case "input" -> "div"; case "div" -> "span"; case "span" -> "div"; case "h1" -> "h2"; case "h2" -> "h3"; default -> "div";
- "text_cont_mod_mut": modify the text inside the Current Target by adding "[The following text has been mutated] " at the beginning.
- "text_cont_rem_mut": remove the entire text inside the Current Target.

## Critical Rules for Angular
### 1. Preserve Angular Syntax
- NEVER modify the syntax of directives: *ngIf, *ngFor, [binding], (event), [(two-way)].
- NEVER touch attributes that start with x-test-.
- Maintain the exact case-sensitivity of all Angular attributes.
### 2. Code Validity
- The mutated code MUST compile in Angular 19 without errors.
- Expressions in {{ }} interpolations must remain valid.
- Form bindings must maintain their hierarchical structure.
### 3. Handling Edge Cases
- Skipping: If a mutation makes no sense for a specific tag (e.g., changing text content on a void element like <input>), DO NOT generate that specific mutant.
- Safety: If a mutation would break Angular compilation, apply a safer alternative or skip it.
- Missing Roles: If the input HTML does not contain a specific role (e.g., no sibling δ exists), skip generation for that role.

## Output Format
For every single generated mutant, output the result in this exact format block. Do not group them.

######### START {role_greek_letter} - {mutation_name} #########
{mutated-code-snippet}
######### END {role_greek_letter} - {mutation_name} #########

**ALWAYS AND ONLY**:
- The complete, mutated HTML code.
- WITHOUT comments or explanations.
- WITHOUT Markdown code blocks ```.
- With correct formatting and indentation preserved.

## Final Notes

Remember: the goal is to generate mutants that:
1.  Are syntactically valid for Angular 19.
2.  Introduce differences detectable by tests.
3.  Maintain the logical structure of the application.
4.  Do not cause TypeScript/Angular compilation errors.

Apply EXCLUSIVELY the requested transformation following these guidelines.
